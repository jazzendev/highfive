### Main Steps

0. [Project Structure][0]
1. [Setup Environment][1]

### Project Structure

* Miscellaneous
  * /doc, documents, including How-To and Guidances
  * /http, API general testing and samples
  * /key, keys used for JWT Token
  * /sql, sql files

* Source Code
  * /src/Common/HighFive.Core, defining the most fundamental models, interfaces, and classes
  * /src/Common/HighFive.Domain
  * /src/WebApp/HighFive.Core
  * /src/WebApp/HighFive.Portal

* Model Transition Flow
  * DB Model -> Domain Model (DTO) -> View Model

* Data Manipulation Flow
  * SQL -> Repository -> Controller

### Setup Environment

1. Key Generation

   * Generate private.pem and public.pem by following the guidance writen in **/key/keyphrase.md**

   * Open **private.pem** with any text editor, copy the content between [-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----] and [-----END PRIVATE KEY-----] from private.pem file

   * Open **/src/WebApp/HighFive.Web.Portal/appsettings.json** file, paste private key to **Token.RsaPrivateKey** config

   * Open **public.pem** with any text editor, copy the content between [-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----] and [-----END PUBLIC KEY-----] from public.pem file

   * Open **/src/WebApp/HighFive.Web.Portal/appsettings.json** file, paste public key to **Token.RsaPublicKey** config

2. Database

   * Open **/src/WebApp/HighFive.Web.Portal/appsettings.json** file
     
   * Paste connection string to **ConnectionString.Database** config, DefaultConnection is used for local development, ProductionConnection is used after production deployment.

   * Run all SQL statements in **/sql** folder to create initial tables and seed data

3. Run

   * Backend API Service: make sure **HighFive.Web.Portal** project is set as startup project, just hit F5 to run ASP project

   * Frontend SPA: install Node.js at first, then navigate to **/src/WebApp/HighFive.Web.Portal/app**, run 'npm start' command
